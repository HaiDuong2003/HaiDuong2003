Question: 
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
No, JAVA does not allow us to do this because the 2 constructors mentioned above have the same number and type of parameters, so the constructor cannot be overloaded.
